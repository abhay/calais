# Calais #
A Ruby interface to the [Open Calais Web Service](http://opencalais.com)

## Features ##
* Accepts documents in text/plain, text/xml and text/html format.
* Basic access to the Open Calais API's Enlighten action.
    * Output is RDF representation of input document.
* Single function ability to extract names, entities and geographies from given text.
  
## Synopsis ##

This is a very basic wrapper to the Open Calais API. It uses the POST endpoint and currently supports the Enlighten action. Here's a simple call:

    Calais.enlighten(
        :content => "The government of the United Kingdom has given corporations like fast food chain McDonald's the right to award high school qualifications to employees who complete a company training program."
        :content_type => :raw,
        :license_id => 'your license id'
    )

This is the easiest way to get the RDF-formated response from the OpenCalais service.

If you want to do something more fun like getting all sorts of fun information about a document, you can try this:

    Calais.process_document(
        :content => "The government of the United Kingdom has given corporations like fast food chain McDonald's the right to award high school qualifications to employees who complete a company training program.",
        :content_type => :raw,
        :license_id => 'your license id'
    )

This will return an object containing information extracted from the RDF response.
